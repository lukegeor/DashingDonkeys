A few notes....

* This repo is currently called DashingDonkeys to avoid any kind of copyright/trademark problems. But I haven't changed the project/solution name yet.
* I'm trying to decide whether I want to have fully procedural code, or use event handling, or a combination where appropriate. Feel free to muck around with that.
* The App folder is currently a console app. I figure easiest to do that first as a test harness, then worry about UIs.
